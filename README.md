Group members: Nadia, Nikolaj & Nicklas

## Group Assignment 1
This repository contains an Airbnb price prediction model created with Pytorch and demonstrated in Gradio.

The notebook goes through the following process:

1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Definition and training of a neural network model with Pytorch
4. Experimentation with hyperparameters
5. Model evaluation
6. Model demonstration in Gradio

An example model is imported as default for experimentation with hyperparameters, based on which 6 experiments are conducted. The experiments touch upon the following types of hyperparameters:

Experiment 1: Activation Function

Experiment 2: Loss Function

Experiment 3: Hidden Layers

Experiment 4: Epochs

Experiment 5: Learning Rate

Experiment 6: Loss Function


The models are then evaluated on the test data by means of R^2 and MSE and the best performing model is demonstrated in Gradio.

If wanted, the other models can be implemented and demonstrated in Gradio as well.



## Group Assingment 2
The Notebook goes through the following process:

1. Feature selection and/or engineering (if necessary)
2. SPreprocessing (if necessary)
3. Train-test split.
4. Defining a neural network architecture in putorch
5. Define a training loop.
6. training the model.
7. Try out different hyperparameters.
8. Evaluate the final model on the test data.
9. Visualize results with Grad.io
